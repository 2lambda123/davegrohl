A Distributed Password Cracker for OS X

## History
DaveGrohl was initially created in early 2010 as a password hash extractor & companion tool to John the Ripper.  It's blossoming into a multithreaded distributed password cracker was a product of sheer curiosity/boredom.  Dave has always been aimed at brute-forcing OS X user passwords, although he's been known to get lost staring into a cloud of Linux machines.

Sadly, my day job as a ninja spy astronaut and my highly Scandinavian level of ethanol consumption has led to an old stanky code base.  In light of these facts, I've decided to unleash the stank upon the world in hopes that it brings joy and nerdgasms to whomever finds it.

## Current Status
Dave does not currently compile on Yosemite.  The last OS that Dave officially supported was Mountain Lion and while version 2.1 will run on Yosemite, the distributed functionality does not.

## Disclaimer
Although Dave is mostly in C++11 & Objective-C, I have never coded professionally in those languages.  If while reading the code you start to get a nosebleed or an erection lasting more than 4 hours, please accept my sincere apologies for my mockery of good coding practices.
